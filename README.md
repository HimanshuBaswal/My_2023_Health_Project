# My Health Project

## The Mission:
> To leverage health data collected over 6 months, starting January 2023 till late June 2023, and create an interactive dashboard/story for personal health insights.

## About the Project:
#### _Data Source:_
The project utilizes personal health data logged daily, covering steps, sleep patterns, heart rate, and workout sessions, tracked through the MI 3 band. The data spans from January 1, 2024, to June 27, 2024, capturing various aspects of health and well-being.

#### _Workbook Structure:_
| Table Name | Fields |
| ------ | ------ |
| Steps Data | Records Total Steps, Distance (KM), Duration, Calories, and Fat Burned.
| Sleep Data | Includes Light Sleep, Deep Sleep, Total Sleep Duration, and Sleep Score.
| Heart Rate Data | Contains Average, Maximum, Minimum, and Resting Heart Rate.
| Workout Data | Logs Workout Duration, Heart Rate Metrics, and Calories Burned.

#### _Tools Utilized:_
| Tool | Usage |
| ------ | ------ |
| Tableau | Employed for visualizing data and creating interactive dashboards |
| Miro | Used for wireframing and designing dashboard layouts |
| Excel | Utilized for data management and preliminary analysis |

## Dashboard Design:
The project comprises four main dashboards:
- Sleep Insights: Focuses on sleep patterns and quality metrics.
- Steps Tracker: Displays daily step count and related statistics.
- Workout Analysis: Highlights workout sessions, intensity levels, and calorie expenditure.
- Overall Health Score: Provides an aggregated view of health metrics and trends.

## Methodology:
### _Approach:_
- Overall Health Score Calculation: Aggregating key metrics to derive an overall health score.
- Sleep Insights: Analyzing sleep duration, quality, and patterns.
- Steps Tracker: Monitoring daily step count and streaks.
- Workout Analysis: Assessing workout intensity, duration, and calorie burn.

### _Tool Utilization:_

- **Miro** - Used for dashboard layout planning, information architecture, metric selection, documentation & Notes.
- **Tableau** - Employed for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.

### _Key Metrics:_
- Overall Health Score: Comprising metrics like Intensity Balance Ratio, Workout Efficiency, and Wellness Hours.
- Heart Rate Score: Evaluating heart rate trends and resting heart rate levels.
- Sleep Quality Metrics: Including Weekend vs. Weekday sleep patterns and Sleep Score analysis.
- Step Tracking Metrics: Incorporating Streak and Step Score for monitoring progress.
- Workout Performance Metrics: Covering Workout Score, Intensity Balance Ratio, and Caloric Expenditure.

## Insights and Takeaways:
### _Dashboard Highlights:_
- Overall Health Score Trends: Tracking improvements or declines in overall health metrics.
- Steps and Sleep Patterns: Identifying correlations between step count and sleep quality.
- Workout Intensity Analysis: Assessing the impact of workout duration and intensity on overall health.

## Conclusion:
Consideration of Scatter plot visualization showcasing Workout Duration vs. Parameters (Score, calories, Heart Rate levels) for deeper insights. Also, analyze variations in health metrics between weekends and weekdays.
